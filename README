		--- `plat', Version 1.0 ---
		---------------------------

Installation of the `plat' package ought to be reasonably straightforward.
The `Makefile' is not very clever, on the other hand there are not many
pitfalls since the code is quite self-contained.  Do the following
steps:

	1. Edit the file `machine.h'.  This has a few options connected
	with the kind of graphics you might want to use.  If you want to
	compile with the X/Motif user interface, version `xplat',
	then make sure that `#define X_WINDOWS' is not commented out.
	Conversely, you should comment it out if you want to compile the
	plain verion `plat', with no interactive graphics.

	2. Edit the `Makefile'.  The only thing you might need to change
	is the GRAPHLIB constant if your X libraries are in a different
	directory to mine.

	3. Depending on which flavour of the program you want, type
	`make xplat' or just plain `make plat' for no interactive
	graphics.

	4. If you typed `make xplat' than copy the X resources file
	`XPlat' to the application defaults directory (on my machine
	this is in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults).

Then try running `xplat' (or respectively `plat') and keep your fingers
crossed.

Help with the commands is to be found in the file `help.txt' (note that
the program assumes it is in the same directory as the help file, in
order to find it).

Extensive documentation in postscript form is found in the subdirectory
`doc'.

An example of a command file is to be found in the shellscript
`example.sh'.
